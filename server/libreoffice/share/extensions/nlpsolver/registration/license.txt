### Why Three Licenses?

The zlib License could have been used instead of the Modified (3-clause) BSD License, and since the IJG
        License effectively subsumes the distribution conditions of the zlib License, this would have effectively
        placed libjpeg-turbo binary distributions under the IJG License. However, the IJG License specifically refers
        to the Independent JPEG Group and does not extend attribution and endorsement protections to other entities.
        Thus, it was desirable to choose a license that granted us the same protections for new code that were granted
        to the IJG for code derived from their software.

### IJG JPEG Library License

In plain English:

We don't promise that this software works. (But if you find any bugs, please let us know!) 

You can use this software for whatever you want. You don't have to pay us.

You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it in a program, you must acknowledge
            somewhere in your documentation that you've used the IJG code.

In legalese:

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied, with respect to this software,
        its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS
        IS", and you, its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane. All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software (or portions thereof) for
        any purpose, without fee, subject to these conditions:

If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this README file must be
            included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to
            the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.

If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation must state that "this
            software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group".

Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full responsibility for any
            undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, not just to the unmodified
        library.  If you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name in advertising or publicity
        relating to this software or products derived from it.  This software may be referred to only as "the
        Independent JPEG Group's software".

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of commercial products, provided
        that all warranty or liability claims are assumed by the product vendor.

ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its
        copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and
        conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, that you
        must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since
        ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
        the foregoing paragraphs do.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free
        Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess,
        config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is also
        freely distributable.

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&T,
        and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For
        this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software. (Since arithmetic
        coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many
        implementations will support it.) So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
        code.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the
        Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to
        produce "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are
        larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.

We are required to state that

### The zlib/libpng License (Zlib)

This software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied warranty. In no event will the authors be

Permission is granted to anyone to use this software for any purpose, including commercial applications, and
        to alter it and redistribute it freely, subject to the following restrictions:

The origin of this software must not be misrepresented; you must not claim that you wrote the original
            software. If you use this software in a product, an acknowledgment in the product documentation would be
            appreciated but is not required.

Altered source versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be misrepresented as being the
            original software.

This notice may not be removed or altered from any source distribution.

MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS

MICROSOFT VISUAL STUDIO 2015 ADD-ONs, VISUAL STUDIO SHELLS and C++ REDISTRIBUTABLE

These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its
        affiliates) and you. They apply to the software named above. The terms also apply to any Microsoft services or
        updates for the software, except to the extent those have different terms.

IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW.

INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.

You may install and use any number of copies of the software.

Backup copy. You may make one backup copy of the software, for reinstalling the software.

TERMS FOR SPECIFIC COMPONENTS.

Utilities. The software may contain some items on the Utilities List at <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=523763&clcid=0x409>.
                You may copy and install those items, if included with the software, on your machines or third party
                machines, to debug and deploy your applications and databases you develop with the software. Please
                note that Utilities are designed for temporary use, that Microsoft may not be able to patch or update
                Utilities separately from the rest of the software, and that some Utilities by their nature may make it
                possible for others to access machines on which they are installed. As a result, you should delete all
                Utilities you have installed after you finish debugging or deploying your applications and databases.
                Microsoft is not responsible for any third party use or access of Utilities you install on any

Microsoft Platforms. The software may include components from Microsoft Windows; Microsoft Windows
                Server; Microsoft SQL Server; Microsoft Exchange; Microsoft Office; and Microsoft SharePoint. These
                components are governed by separate agreements and their own product support policies, as described in
                the license terms found in the installation directory for that component or in the “Licenses”
                folder accompanying the software.

Third Party Components. The software may include third party components with separate legal notices
                or governed by other agreements, as may be described in the ThirdPartyNotices file accompanying the
                software. Even if such components are governed by other agreements, the disclaimers and the limitations
                on and exclusions of damages below also apply.

DATA. The software may collect information about you and your use of the software, and send that to
            Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve our products and services.
            You may opt-out of many of these scenarios, but not all, as described in the product documentation. There
            are also some features in the software that may enable you to collect data from users of your applications.
            If you use these features to enable data collection in your applications, you must comply with applicable
            law, including providing appropriate notices to users of your applications. You can learn more about data
            collection and use in the help documentation and the privacy statement at <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=528096&clcid=0x409>.

SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use
            the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this
            limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must
            comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You
            may not

work around any technical limitations in the software;

reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only to the extent that
                applicable law expressly permits, despite this limitation;

remove, minimize, block or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in the software;

use the software in any way that is against the law; or

share, publish or lend the software, or provide the software as a stand-alone hosted as solution
                for others to use, or transfer the software or this agreement to any third party.

EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. Microsoft software, online services, professional services and related technology
            are subject to U.S. export jurisdiction. You must comply with all applicable international and national
            laws, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations,
            Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions programs, and end-user, end use and destination restrictions by
            the U.S. and other governments related to Microsoft products, services and technologies. For additional
            information, see www.microsoft.com/exporting <http://www.microsoft.com/exporting>.

SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is “as is,” we may not provide support services for
            it.

ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and
            support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.

APPLICABLE LAW. If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington law applies to
            interpretation of and claims for breach of this agreement, and the laws of the state where you live apply
            to all other claims. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply.

LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws
            of your state or country. This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your state or
            country if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so. Without limitation of the
            foregoing, for Australia, YOU HAVE STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER THE AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER LAW AND NOTHING IN
            THESE TERMS IS INTENDED TO AFFECT THOSE RIGHTS

DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS-IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT
            GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS,
            MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
            NON-INFRINGEMENT.

LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT
            DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS,
            SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
            This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on
            third party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, breach of
            warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by
            applicable law.
            It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above
            limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation
            of incidental, consequential or other damages.

### The TWAIN License

The TWAIN Working Group grants customer ("Customer") the worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to
        reproduce and distribute the software and documentation of the TWAIN toolkit ("TWAIN Toolkit"). The TWAIN Toolkit
        was designed to be used by third parties to assist them in becoming compliant with the TWAIN standard, but it has

        express or statutory, including, without limitation, the implied warranties of merchantability, non infringement of
        third party rights and fitness for a particular purpose. The TWAIN Working Group disclaims all liability for
        damages, whether direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential, arising from the reproduction,
        distribution, modification, or other use of the TWAIN Toolkit.

As a condition of this license, Customer agrees to include in software programs based in whole or in part on the
        TWAIN Toolkit the following provisions in (i) the header or similar file in such software and (ii) prominently in
        its documentation and to require its sublicensees to include these provisions in similar locations: The TWAIN
        Toolkit is distributed as is. The developer and distributors of the TWAIN Toolkit expressly disclaim all implied,
        express or statutory warranties including, without limitation, the implied warranties of merchantability, non
        infringement of third party rights and fitness for a particular purpose. Neither the developers nor the
        distributors will be liable for damages, whether direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential, as a

This Font Software is Copyright (c) 2003-2006, Philipp H. Poll (http://linuxlibertine.sf.net/).
        All Rights Reserved.
        "Linux Libertine" is a Reserved Font Name for this Font Software.

Graphite extension of the original Linux Libertine font was made by Laszlo Nemeth under the same
        license.
        Our fonts are free in the sense of the GPL. In short: Changing the font is allowed as long as the derivative
        work is published under the same license again. Pedantics keep claiming that the embedded use of GPL-fonts in
        i.e. PDFs requires the free publication of the PDF as well. This is why our GPL contains the so called "font
        exception".

Jump to GPL version 2

As a special exception, if you create a document which uses this font, and embed this font or unaltered
        portions of this font into the document, this font does not by itself cause the resulting document to be
        covered by the GNU General Public License. This exception does not however invalidate any other reasons why the
        document might be covered by the GNU General Public License. If you modify this font, you may extend this
        exception to your version of the font, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete
        this exception statement from your version.

Additionally our fonts are licensed under the Open Fonts License (see below).

### SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.0 - 22 November 2005

PREAMBLE The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of cooperative font
        projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide an open
        framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they are
        not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and
        sold with any software provided that the font names of derivative works are changed. The fonts and derivatives,
        however, cannot be released under any other type of license.

DEFINITIONS "Font Software" refers to any and all of the following:  - font files -
        data files - source code - build scripts -
        documentation

"Reserved Font Name" refers to the Font Software name as seen by users and any other names as specified
        after the copyright statement.

"Standard Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as distributed by the Copyright
        Holder.

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative font software made by adding to, deleting, or substituting -- in
        part or in whole -- any of the components of the Standard Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font
        Software to a new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical writer or other person who contributed to
        the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of

        within text or binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font Name(s), in part or in whole, unless
        explicit written permission is granted by the Copyright Holder. This restriction applies to all references
        stored in the Font Software, such as the font menu name and other font description fields, which are used to
        differentiate the font from others.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder or the Author(s) of the Font Software shall not be used to promote,

These patterns were manually converted from TeX hyphenation patterns using the guide at http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/SL/Using_TeX_hyphenation_patterns_in_OpenOffice.org

Original version: http://tug.org/svn/texhyphen/trunk/hyph-utf8/tex/generic/hyph-utf8/patterns/txt/hyph-hr.pat.txt?revision=416

License: OpenOffice.org adaption of this file is licensed under the GNU LGPL license.

Jump to LGPL Version 2.1

Original license text: This file is part of hyph-utf8 package and resulted from semi-manual conversions of
        hyphenation patterns into UTF-8 in June 2008.

Source: hrhyph.tex (1996-04-10) Author: Marinović Igor <migor at student.math.hr>

The above mentioned file should become obsolete, and the author of the original file should preferably
        modify this file instead.

Modifications were needed in order to support native UTF-8 engines, but functionality (hopefully) didn't
        change in any way, at least not intentionally. This file is no longer stand-alone; at least for 8-bit engines
        you probably want to use loadhyph-foo.tex (which will load this file) instead.

Modifications were done by Jonathan Kew, Mojca Miklavec & Arthur Reutenauer with help & support
        from: - Karl Berry, who gave us free hands and all resources - Taco Hoekwater, with useful macros - Hans Hagen,
        who did the unicodifisation of patterns already long before and helped with testing, suggestions and bug
        reports - Norbert Preining, who tested & integrated patterns into TeX Live

However, the "copyright/copyleft" owner of patterns remains the original author.

The copyright statement of this file is thus:

Do with this file whatever needs to be done in future for the sake of "a better world" as long as you
        respect the copyright of original file. If you're the original author of patterns or taking over a new
        revolution, please remove all of the TUG comments & credits that we added here - you are the Queen / the
        King, we are only the servants.

If you want to change this file, rather than uploading directly to CTAN, we would be grateful if you could
        send it to us (http://tug.org/tex-hyphen) or ask for credentials for
        SVN repository and commit it yourself; we will then upload the whole "package" to CTAN.

Before a new "pattern-revolution" starts, please try to follow some guidelines if possible:

- \lccode is *forbidden*, and I really mean it - all the patterns should be in UTF-8 - the only "allowed"
        TeX commands in this file are: \patterns, \hyphenation, and if you really cannot do without, also \input and
        \message - in particular, please no \catcode or \lccode changes, they belong to loadhyph-foo.tex, and no
        \lefthyphenmin and \righthyphenmin, they have no influence here and belong elsewhere - \begingroup and/or
        \endinput is not needed - feel free to do whatever you want inside comments

We know that TeX is extremely powerful, but give a stupid parser at least a chance to read your
        patterns.

Wordlist en_CA spelling and morphological dictionary for OpenOffice.org

Version 2008-12-18

 

Based on Wordlist Hunspell dictionaries version 2008-12-05

and Wordlist POS and AGID data created by Kevin Atkinson

and released on http://wordlist.sourceforge.net.

 

Other fixes:

 

OOo Issue 48060 - add numbers with affixes by COMPOUNDRULE (1st, 111th, 1990s etc.)

New REP items (better suggestions for accented words and a few mistakes)

OOo Issue 63541 - remove *dessicated, *dessication

 

László Németh <nemeth at OO.o>

 

Original license:

 

2008-12-05 Release

 

README file for en_US and en_CA Hunspell dictionaries

 

These dictionaries are created using the speller/make-hunspell-dict

dictionary in SCOWL, SVN revision 74.

 

The NOSUGGEST flag was added to certain taboo words.  While I made an

honest attempt to flag the strongest taboo words with the NOSUGGEST

flag, I MAKE NO GUARANTEE THAT I FLAGGED EVERY POSSIBLE TABOO WORD.

The list was originally derived from Németh László, however I removed

some words which, while being considered taboo by some dictionaries,

are not really considered swear words in today's society.

 

You can find SCOWL and friend at http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/.

Bug reports should go to the Issue Tracker found on the previously

mentioned web site.  General discussion should go to the

wordlist-devel at sourceforge net mailing list.

 

COPYRIGHT, SOURCES, and CREDITS:

 

The en_US and en_CA dictionaries come directly from SCOWL (up to level

60) and is thus under the same copyright of SCOWL.  The affix file is

a heavily modified version of the original english.aff file which was

released as part of Geoff Kuenning's Ispell and as such is covered by

his BSD license.  Part of SCOWL is also based on Ispell thus the

Ispell copyright is included with the SCOWL copyright.

 

The collective work is Copyright 2000-2007 by Kevin Atkinson as well

as any of the copyrights mentioned below:

 

  Copyright 2000-2007 by Kevin Atkinson

 

  Permission to use, copy, modify, distribute and sell these word

  lists, the associated scripts, the output created from the scripts,

  provided that the above copyright notice appears in all copies and

  that both that copyright notice and this permission notice appear in

  supporting documentation. Kevin Atkinson makes no representations

  about the suitability of this array for any purpose. It is provided

  "as is" without express or implied warranty.

 

Alan Beale <biljir@pobox.com> also deserves special credit as he has,

in addition to providing the 12Dicts package and being a major

contributor to the ENABLE word list, given me an incredible amount of

feedback and created a number of special lists (those found in the

Supplement) in order to help improve the overall quality of SCOWL.

 

The 10 level includes the 1000 most common English words (according to

the Moby (TM) Words II [MWords] package), a subset of the 1000 most

common words on the Internet (again, according to Moby Words II), and

frequently class 16 from Brian Kelk's "UK English Wordlist

with Frequency Classification".

 

The MWords package was explicitly placed in the public domain:

 

    The Moby lexicon project is complete and has

    been place into the public domain. Use, sell,

    rework, excerpt and use in any way on any platform.

 

    Placing this material on internal or public servers is

    also encouraged. The compiler is not aware of any

    export restrictions so freely distribute world-wide.

 

    You can verify the public domain status by contacting

 

    Grady Ward

    grady@netcom.com

    grady@northcoast.com

 

The "UK English Wordlist With Frequency Classification" is also in the

Public Domain:

 

  Date: Sat, 08 Jul 2000 20:27:21 +0100

  From: Brian Kelk <Brian.Kelk@cl.cam.ac.uk>

 

  > I was wondering what the copyright status of your "UK English

  > Wordlist With Frequency Classification" word list as it seems to

  > be lacking any copyright notice.

 

  There were many many sources in total, but any text marked

  "copyright" was avoided. Locally-written documentation was one

  source. An earlier version of the list resided in a filespace called

  PUBLIC on the University mainframe, because it was considered public

  domain.

 

  Date: Tue, 11 Jul 2000 19:31:34 +0100

 

  > So are you saying your word list is also in the public domain?

 

  That is the intention.

 

The 20 level includes frequency classes 7-15 from Brian's word list.

 

The 35 level includes frequency classes 2-6 and words appearing in at

least 11 of 12 dictionaries as indicated in the 12Dicts package.  All

words from the 12Dicts package have had likely inflections added via

my inflection database.

 

The 12Dicts package and Supplement is in the Public Domain.

Inflections database, is under the following copyright:

The 40 level includes words from Alan's 3esl list found in version 4.0

of his 12dicts package.  Like his other stuff the 3esl list is also in the

public domain.

 

The 50 level includes Brian's frequency class 1, words appearing

in at least 5 of 12 of the dictionaries as indicated in the 12Dicts

package, and uppercase words in at least 4 of the previous 12

dictionaries.  A decent number of proper names is also included: The

top 1000 male, female, and Last names from the 1990 Census report; a

list of names sent to me by Alan Beale; and a few names that I added

myself.  Finally a small list of abbreviations not commonly found in

other word lists is included.

 

The name files form the Census report is a government document which I

don't think can be copyrighted.

 

The file special-jargon.50 uses common.lst and word.lst from the

Unofficial Jargon File Word Lists" which is derived from "The Jargon

.  All of which is in the Public Domain.  This file also contain

a few extra UNIX terms which are found in the file "unix-terms" in the

special/ directory.

The 55 level includes words from Alan's 2of4brif list found in version

4.0 of his 12dicts package.  Like his other stuff the 2of4brif is also

in the public domain.

 

The 60 level includes Brian's frequency class 0 and all words

appearing in at least 2 of the 12 dictionaries as indicated by the

12Dicts package.  A large number of names are also included: The 4,946

female names and the 3,897 male names from the MWords package.

 

The 70 level includes the 74,550 common dictionary words and the

21,986 names list from the MWords package The common dictionary words,

like those from the 12Dicts package, have had all likely inflections

added.  The 70 level also included the 5desk list from version 4.0 of

the 12Dics package which is the public domain

 

The 80 level includes the ENABLE word list, all the lists in the

ENABLE supplement package (except for ABLE), the "UK Advanced Cryptics

(UKACD), the list of signature words in from YAWL package,

and the 10,196 places list from the MWords package.

 

The ENABLE package, mainted by M\Cooper <thegrendel@theriver.com>,

is in the Public Domain:

 

  The ENABLE master word list, WORD.LST, is herewith formally released

  into the Public Domain. Anyone is free to use it or distribute it in

  any manner they see fit. No fee or registration is required for its

  use nor are "contributions" solicited (if you feel you absolutely

  must contribute something for your own peace of mind, the authors of

  the ENABLE list ask that you make a donation on their behalf to your

  favorite charity). This word list is our gift to the Scrabble

  community, as an alternate to "official" word lists. Game designers

  may feel free to incorporate the WORD.LST into their games. Please

  mention the source and credit us as originators of the list. Note

  that if you, as a game designer, use the WORD.LST in your product,

  you may still copyright and protect your product, but you may *not*

  legally copyright or in any way restrict redistribution of the

  WORD.LST portion of your product. This *may* under law restrict your

  rights to restrict your users' rights, but that is only fair.

The 95 level includes the 354,984 single words and 256,772 compound

words from the MWords package, ABLE.LST from the ENABLE Supplement,

and some additional words found in my part-of-speech database that

were not found anywhere else.

Clarification:

The GNU Lesser General Public License or LGPL is written for software libraries in the first place. We
            expressly want the LGPL to be valid for this artwork library too.

KDE Oxygen theme icons is a special kind of software library, it is an artwork library, it's elements
            can be used in a Graphical User Interface, or GUI.

Source code, for this library means:

where they exist, SVG;

otherwise, if applicable, the multi-layered formats xcf or psd, or otherwise png.

The LGPL in some sections obliges you to make the files carry notices. With images this is in some cases
            impossible or hardly useful.

With this library a notice is placed at a prominent place in the directory containing the elements. You
            may follow this practice.

The exception in section 5 of the GNU Lesser General Public License covers the use of elements of this
            art library in a GUI.

# GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is
        not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of
        the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

## 0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the
        “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined
        Work as defined below.

An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not
        otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using
        an interface provided by the Library.

A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The
        particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked
        Version”.

The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined
        Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on
        the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for
        the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
        Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

## 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the
        GNU GPL.

## 2. Conveying Modified Versions.

If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to
        be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is
        invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:

under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an
            Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part
            of its purpose remains meaningful, or

under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that
            copy.

## 3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the
        Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
        material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline
        functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the
            Library and its use are covered by this License.

Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

## 4. Combined Works.

You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict
        modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for
        debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the
            Library and its use are covered by this License.

Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for
            the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and
            this license document.

Do one of the following:
                Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding
                    Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or
                    relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined
                    Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is
                    one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system,
                    and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible
                    with the Linked Version.

Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding
                    Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or
                    relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined
                    Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.

Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is
                    one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system,
                    and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible
                    with the Linked Version.

Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such
            information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to
            install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
            Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation
            Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use
            option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU
            GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

## 5. Combined Libraries.

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library
        together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and
        convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any
            other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.

Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and
            explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

## 6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public
        License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ
        in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a
        certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you
        have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version
        published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number
        of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License
        ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU
        Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
        permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

# GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 2.1, February 1999

## Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast,
        the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
        make sure the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software
        packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can
        use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public
        License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses
        are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
        service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the
        software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to
        ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
        distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the
        recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
        code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so
        that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must
        show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this
        license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library.
        Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have
        is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that
        might be introduced by others.

Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure
        that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from
        a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
        consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This
        license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different
        from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking
        those libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of
        the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public
        License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser
        General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom
        than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage
        over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License
        for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a
        certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to
        use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free
        libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use
        the Lesser General Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of
        people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free
        programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux
        operating system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the
        user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using
        a modified version of the Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to
        the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains
        code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.

## TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a
        notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
        this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked
        with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these
        terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that
        is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
        translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
        the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library,
        complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
        definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are
        outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a
        program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the
        Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program
        that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you
        receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
        appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
        and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
        protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a
        work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
        above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you
            changed the files and the date of any change.

c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third
            parties under the terms of this License.

d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be
                supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the
                facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application
                does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its
                purpose remains meaningful.
                (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely
                well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
                application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does
                not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)

(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely
                well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
                application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does
                not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not
        derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
        this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But
        when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution
        of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
        whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely
        by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective
        works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work
        based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
        scope of this License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of
        this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this
        License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License.
        (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can
        specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.

Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General
        Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a
        library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section
        2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it
        with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
        Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering
        equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the
        source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to
        work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a
        work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this
        License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative
        of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The
        executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such
        executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object
        code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is
        true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a
        library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small
        macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is
        unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code
        plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under
        the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are
        linked directly with the Library itself.

6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses
        the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
        under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use
        and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the
        Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during
        execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well
        as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:

a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for
            the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1
            and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable
            "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library
            and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that
            the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to
            recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)

b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable
            mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer
            system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a
            modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
            interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give
            the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
            performing this distribution.

d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated
            place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.

e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you
            have already sent this user a copy.

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility
        programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be
        distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the
        major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless
        that component itself accompanies the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that
        do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the
        Library together in an executable that you distribute.

7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a
        single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a
        combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other
        library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library,
            uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections
            above.

b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a
            work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same
            work.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as
        expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
        distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
        parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
        terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,
        nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions
        are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library
        (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms
        and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the
        recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify
        the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the
        recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
        parties with this License.

11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for
        any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
        agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
        conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
        this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at
        all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those
        who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
        License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the
        balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
        circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims
        or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the
        free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
        generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
        application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
        software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this
        License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either
        by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this
        License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
        distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates
        the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser
        General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
        but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this
        License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
        either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does
        not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
        Foundation.

14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose
        distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software
        which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
        exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all
        derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY,
        TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
        OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
        BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE
        RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
        ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY
        COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
        LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
        THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
        INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
        SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

## END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend
        making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution
        under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start
        of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
        the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright
        disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

That's all there is to it!

# GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 2, June 1991

## Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast,
        the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
        make sure the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially designated Free Software
        Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for your
        libraries, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are
        designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
        service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
        software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask
        you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
        copies of the library, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the
        recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
        code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients so that
        they can relink them with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must
        show them these terms so they know their rights.

Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you this
        license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no
        warranty for this free library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
        recipients to know that what they have is not the original version, so that any problems introduced by others
        will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that
        companies distributing free software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the
        program into proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for
        everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License, which
        was designed for utility programs. This license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
        designated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and
        don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license.

The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually
        make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without
        changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to running a utility program
        or application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
        derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such.

Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License for libraries did not
        effectively promote software sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that
        weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all benefit
        from the free status of the libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intended to permit
        developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user of such programs
        to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve this as regards
        changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.)
        The hope is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to
        the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains
        code derived from the library, while the latter only works together with the library.

Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General Public License rather than by
        this special one.

## TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed by
        the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
        General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked
        with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these
        terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that
        is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
        translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
        the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library,
        complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
        definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are
        outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a
        program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the
        Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program
        that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you
        receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
        appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
        and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
        protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a
        work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
        above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you
            changed the files and the date of any change.

c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third
            parties under the terms of this License.

d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be
                supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the
                facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application
                does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its
                purpose remains meaningful.
                (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely
                well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
                application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does
                not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)

(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely
                well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
                application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does
                not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not
        derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
        this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But
        when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution
        of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
        whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely
        by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective
        works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work
        based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
        scope of this License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of
        this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this
        License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License.
        (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can
        specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.

Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General
        Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a
        library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section
        2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it
        with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
        Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering
        equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the
        source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to
        work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a
        work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this
        License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative
        of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The
        executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such
        executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object
        code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is
        true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a
        library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small
        macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is
        unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code
        plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under
        the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are
        linked directly with the Library itself.

6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a "work that uses
        the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
        under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use
        and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the
        Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during
        execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well
        as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:

a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for
            the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1
            and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable
            "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library
            and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that
            the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to
            recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)

b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give
            the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
            performing this distribution.

c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated
            place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.

d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you
            have already sent this user a copy.

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility
        programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the source code
        distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the
        major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless
        that component itself accompanies the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that
        do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the
        Library together in an executable that you distribute.

7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a
        single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a
        combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other
        library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library,
            uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections
            above.

b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a
            work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same
            work.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as
        expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
        distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
        parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
        terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,
        nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions
        are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library
        (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms
        and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the
        recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify
        the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the
        recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
        parties to this License.

11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for
        any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
        agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
        conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
        this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at
        all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those
        who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
        License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the
        balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
        circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims
        or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the
        free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
        generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
        application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
        software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this
        License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either
        by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this
        License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
        distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates
        the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Library
        General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
        but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this
        License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
        either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does
        not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
        Foundation.

14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose
        distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software
        which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
        exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all
        derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY,
        TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
        OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
        BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE
        RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
        ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY
        COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
        LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
        THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
        INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
        SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

## END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend
        making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution
        under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start
        of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
        the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright
        disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

That's all there is to it!

# GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is
        not allowed.

### Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and
        change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share
        and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free
        Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other
        work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are
        designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if
        you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use
        pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender
        the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you
        modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to
        the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
        source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software,
        and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this
        free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed,
        so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside
        them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users'
        freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for
        individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version
        of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains,
        we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect
        the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to
        restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid
        the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent
        this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

### TERMS AND CONDITIONS

“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor
        masks.

“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed
        as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright
        permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of
        the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.

A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or
        secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or
        modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making
        available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies.
        Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a
        convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the
        user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees
        may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a
        list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.
        “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.

A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized
        standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is
        widely used among developers working in that language.

The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a)
        is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component,
        and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface
        for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this
        context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
        (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code
        interpreter used to run it.

The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate,
        install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control
        those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or
        generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not
        part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source
        files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work
        is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
        subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts
        of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are
        irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission
        to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the
        output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or
        other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your
        license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them
        make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that
        you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.
        Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your
        direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside
        their relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing
        is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law
        fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar
        laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures
        to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the
        covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of
        enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
        technological measures.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
        you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all
        notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
        code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License
        along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty
        protection for a fee.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form
        of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.

b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any
            conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact
            all notices”.

c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession
            of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the
            whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission
            to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately
            received it.

d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however,
            if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not
            make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature
        extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a
        volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting
        copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the
        individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to
        the other parts of the aggregate.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you
        also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these
        ways:

a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution
            medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for
            software interchange.

b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution
            medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer
            spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either
            (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License,
            on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your
            reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding
            Source from a network server at no charge.

c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the
            Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you
            received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and
            offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further
            charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the
            place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server
            (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear
            directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server
            hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed
            to satisfy these requirements.

e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the
            object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under
            subsection 6d.

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a
        System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.

A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property
        which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
        incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be
        resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used”
        refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or
        of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product
        is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer
        uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or
        other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
        a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
        functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification
        has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User
        Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User
        Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is
        characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation
        Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to
        install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide
        support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
        the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the
        modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
        protocols for communication across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in
        a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form),
        and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from
        one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be
        treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.
        If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those
        permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional
        permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that
        copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain
        cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered
        work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if
        authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this
            License; or

b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material
            or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of
            such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or

e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service
            marks; or

f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the
            material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any
            liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of
        section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed
        by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license
        document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to
        a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction
        does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source
        files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the
        applicable terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license,
        or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
        otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License
        (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is
        reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your
        license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable
        means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder
        notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of
        violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30
        days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received
        copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
        reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary
        propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a
        copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to
        propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.
        Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do
        so.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
        licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for
        enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all
        assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work
        results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also
        receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous
        paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest,
        if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this
        License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted
        under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
        alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the
        Program or any portion of it.

A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on
        which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.

A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor,
        whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this
        License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be
        infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this
        definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the
        requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's
        essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the
        contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however
        denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue
        for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or
        commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the
        work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
        publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the
        Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent
        license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License,
        to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge
        that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the
        covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason
        to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by
        procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the
        covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the
        patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on
        it.

A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits
        the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically
        granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third
        party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based
        on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
        parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with
        copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in
        connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that
        arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to
        infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the
        conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a
        covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
        obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that
        obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way
        you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the
        Program.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work
        with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and
        to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered
        work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction
        through a network will apply to the combination as such.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from
        time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
        address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered
        version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of
        following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the
        Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License,
        you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can
        be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that
        version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations
        are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
        STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY
        OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
        MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
        PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
        OR CORRECTION.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY
        OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING
        ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
        PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
        OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
        PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect
        according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute
        waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability
        accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

### How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way
        to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each
        source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
        “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an
        interactive mode:

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public
        License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about
        box”.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright
        disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU
        GPL, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your
        program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
        with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this
        License. But first, please read <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.

# GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 2, June 1991

### Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast,
        the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make
        sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
        Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software
        Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your
        programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are
        designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
        service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
        software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask
        you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
        copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the
        recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
        And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which
        gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is
        no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
        recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not
        reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that
        redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
        proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or
        not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

### TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the
        copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program",
        below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
        derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
        verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included
        without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are
        outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered
        only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the
        Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive
        it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
        copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
        absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the
        Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
        protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a
        work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
        above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not
        derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
        this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But
        when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution
        of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
        whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely
        by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective
        works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work
        based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
        scope of this License.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in
        object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
        following:

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an
        executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
        associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
        executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
        normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)
        of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
        executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place,
        then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the
        source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly
        provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
        void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
        copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
        remain in full compliance.

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,
        nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions
        are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program
        (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms
        and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient
        automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject
        to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
        rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any
        other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
        or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of
        this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
        any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example,
        if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
        directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
        refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the
        balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
        circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims
        or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the
        free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
        generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
        application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
        software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this
        License.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either
        by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
        License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
        distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates
        the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General
        Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
        differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this
        License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
        either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does
        not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
        Foundation.

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose
        distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
        copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
        exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all
        derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM,
        TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
        OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
        BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE
        RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
        ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY
        COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
        LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
        THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
        INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
        PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts
        of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show
        w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
        program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright
        disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your
        program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
        with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU

# Common Public License Version 1.0 (CPL)

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY
        USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this
            Agreement, and

b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

i) changes to the Program, and

ii) additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that
            particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
            such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include
            additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the
            Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by
        the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all
        Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive,
            worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
            publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
            derivative works, in source code and object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive,
            worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and
            otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This
            patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the
            Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
            covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include
            the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set
            forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent
            or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
            Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or
            otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
            assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example,
            if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's
            responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its
            Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement,
        provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and
            implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
            conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct,
            indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor
            alone and not by any other party; and

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs
            licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
            exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that
        reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users,
        business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
        the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does
        not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a
        commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
        every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively
        "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the
        Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
        connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this
        section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
        infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
        Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with
        the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor
        may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That
        Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or
        offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial
        Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims
        against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any
        other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
        WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES
        OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient
        is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
        risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and
        costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
        unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY
        LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT
        LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,
        OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR
        THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
        the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by
        the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
        valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to
        software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that
        Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In
        addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim
        in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
        hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall
        terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the
        material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time
        after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient
        agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's
        obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
        and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid
        inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement
        Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
        No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement
        Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity.
        Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
        Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received.
        In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program
        (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)
        above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this
        Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly
        granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of
        the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more
        than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting
        litigation.

## 2. Source Code License.

### 2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.

The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third
    party intellectual property claims:

under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable
        by Initial Developer to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original Code
        (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or selling of Original
        Code, to make, have made, use, practice, sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original
        Code (or portions thereof).

the licenses granted in this Section 2.1 (a) and (b) are effective on the date
        Initial Developer first distributes Original Code under the terms of this License.

Notwithstanding Section 2.1 (b) above,
        no patent license is granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2) separate from the Original
        Code; or 3) for infringements caused by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the combination of the
        Original Code with other software or devices.

### 2.2. Contributor Grant.

Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide,
    royalty-free, non-exclusive license

under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable
        by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications
        created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as
        Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of
        Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or
        portions of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1)
        Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of Modifications made by
        that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination).

the licenses granted in Sections 2.2 (a) and 2.2 (b) are effective on the date
        Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Covered Code.

Notwithstanding Section 2.2 (b) above,
        no patent license is granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; 2)
        separate from the Contributor Version; 3) for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of
        Contributor Version or ii) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software
        (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered
        Code in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.

## 3. Distribution Obligations.

### 3.1. Application of License.

The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License,
    including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered
    Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under
    Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of
    the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or
    restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an
    additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

### 3.2. Availability of Source Code.

Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under
    the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic
    Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via
    Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
    initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
    has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains
    available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

### 3.3. Description of Modifications.

You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to
    create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification
    is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of
    the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related
    documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

### 3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to
    exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled
    "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know
    whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in
    Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
    Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or
    newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been
    obtained.

If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of
    patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include
    this information in the legal file.

Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4 (a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's
    original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

### 3.5. Required Notices.

You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code.
    If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must
    include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a
    notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described
    in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the
    Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to
    offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
    Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
    Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation
    is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
    liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
    liability terms You offer.

### 3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.

You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the
    Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of
    how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice
    must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which
    You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
    Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
    provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version
    does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in
    this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear
    that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
    Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
    by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

### 3.7. Larger Works.

You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License
    and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this
    License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

## 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the
    Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
    to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be
    included in the legal file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
    extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of
    ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

## 5. Application of this License.

This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

## 6. Versions of the License.

### 6.1. New Versions

Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from
    time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

### 6.2. Effect of New Versions

Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use
    it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent
    version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms
    applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

### 6.3. Derivative Works

If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code
    which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases
    "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
    license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your
    version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License.
    (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

## 7. Disclaimer of warranty

Covered code is provided under this license on an "as is" basis, without warranty of
    any kind, either expressed or implied, including, without limitation, warranties that the covered code is free of
    defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and
    performance of the covered code is with you. Should any covered code prove defective in any respect, you (not the
    initial developer or any other contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair or correction. This
    disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this license. No use of any covered code is authorized
    hereunder except under this disclaimer.

## 8. Termination

8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if
    You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
    All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License.
    Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding
    declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor
    against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:

such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any
        patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60
        days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You
        either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and
        future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
        the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment
        arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn,
        the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or
        2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period
        specified above.

any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor
        Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under
        Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are
        revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by
        that Participant.

8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such
    Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
    by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of
    the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
    license.

8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements
    (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to
    termination shall survive termination.

## 9. Limitation of liability

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
    negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall you, the initial developer, any other contributor, or any distributor of
    covered code, or any supplier of any of such parties, be liable to any person for any indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill,
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such
    party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to
    liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law
    prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
    consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to you.

## 10. U.S. government end users

The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software
    documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.
    1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June
    1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

## 11. Miscellaneous

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this
    License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
    enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
    any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one
    party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any
    litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
    District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for
    costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of
    the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
    regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to
    this License.

## 12. Responsibility for claims

As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising,
    directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial
    Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
    shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

## 13. Multiple-licensed code

Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as "Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means
    that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the
    MPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in
    Exhibit A.

## Exhibit A - Mozilla Public License.

NOTE: The text of this Exhibit A may differ slightly from the text of the notices in the Source Code files of
    the Original Code. You should use the text of this Exhibit A rather than the text found in the Original Code Source
    Code for Your Modifications.

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:

under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to
            use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its

    the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.

### 2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or
    licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding
    Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party´s modifications of Covered Software, or
            (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version);
            or

for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party´s modifications of Covered Software, or
            (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version);

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as
    may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

### 2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a
    subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under
    the terms of Section 3.3).

### 2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it
    has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

### 2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair
    dealing, or other equivalents.

### 2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.

## 3. Responsibilities

### 3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to
    which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
    of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License.
    You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients´ rights in the Source Code Form.

### 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and
            You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
            reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient;
            and

such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and
            You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
            reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient;
            and

You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under
            different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
            recipients´ rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under
            different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
            recipients´ rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

### 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the
    requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with
    a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary
    Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such
    Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
    Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).

### 3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices,
    disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
    Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual
    inaccuracies.

### 3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one
    or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any
    Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation
    is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such
    Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
    disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.

## 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the
    Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this
    License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
    must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to
    the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of
    ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

## 5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its
    terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
    are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants,
    and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means
    prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are
    reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means,
    this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You
    become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding
    declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
    indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered
    Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding
    distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
    termination shall survive termination.

## 6. Disclaimer of Warranty

Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without warranty of any kind,
    either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is
    free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality
    and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,
    You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of
    warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this
    License except under this disclaimer.

## 7. Limitation of Liability

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or
    otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You
    for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without
    limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and
    all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such
    damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
    party´s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the
    exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to
    You.

## 8. Litigation

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant
    maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction,
    without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party´s ability to
    bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

## 9. Miscellaneous

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this
    License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
    enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
    drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

## 10. Versions of the License

### 10.1. New Versions

Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license
    steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
    distinguishing version number.

### 10.2. Effect of New Versions

You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally
    received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.

### 10.3. Modified Versions

If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you
    may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the
    name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).

### 10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses

If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of
    this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

## Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL
        was not distributed with this file, You can obtain one at https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a
    location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a
    notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

## Exhibit B - “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” Notice

This Source Code Form is “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses”, as defined by the Mozilla Public
        License, v. 2.0.

# SIL Open Font
    License Version 1.1 – 26 February 2007

PREAMBLE The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of collaborative font
    projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
    open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they are not
    sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold
    with any software provided that the font names of derivative works are changed. The fonts and derivatives, however,
    cannot be released under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not
    apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright Holder(s) under this license
    and clearly marked as such. This may include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as distributed by the Copyright
    Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting, or substituting – in part or in whole
    -- any of the components of the Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a new
    environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical writer or other person who contributed to the
    Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of the
    Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify, redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of
    the Font Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components, in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold
    by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled, redistributed and/or sold with any
    software, provided that each copy contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be included
    either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields
    within text or binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font Name(s) unless explicit written permission
    is granted by the corresponding Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
    presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font Software shall not be used to promote,
    endorse or advertise any Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and
    the Author(s) or with their explicit written permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must be distributed entirely under this
    license, and must not be distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this
    license does not apply to any document created using the Font Software.

TERMINATION This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are not met.

DISCLAIMER THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING
    BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF
    COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM,
    DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER
    IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR
    FROM OTHER DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.

        statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
        reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your

    acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect,
    special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the
    use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
    computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
    been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative
    Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other
    liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may
    act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if

# The LaTeX Project Public License

LPPL Version 1.3c 2008-05-04

Copyright 1999 2002-2008 LaTeX3 Project

Everyone is allowed to distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but modification of it is not
        allowed.

## PREAMBLE

The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the primary license under which the LaTeX kernel and the base
        LaTeX packages are distributed.

You may use this license for any work of which you hold the copyright and which you wish to distribute. This
        license may be particularly suitable if your work is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but it is written
        in such a way that you can use it even if your work is unrelated to TeX.

The section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE', below, gives instructions, examples,
        and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their works under this license.

This license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed and modified, as well as conditions
        under which modified versions of that work may be distributed.

We, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you the freedom to make and distribute
        modified versions of your work that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while maintaining
        the availability, integrity, and reliability of that work. If you do not see how to achieve your goal while
        meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex' and `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX
        distribution for suggestions.

## DEFINITIONS

In this license document the following terms are used:

## CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

Activities other than distribution and/or modification of the Work are not covered by this license;
            they are outside its scope. In particular, the act of running the Work is not restricted and no
            requirements are made concerning any offers of support for the Work.

You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you received it. Distribution of only
            part of the Work is considered modification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived Work may
            be assumed under the terms of this clause.

You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a complete, unmodified copy of the Work
            as distributed under Clause 2 above, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that the
            recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly as it would have been installed if they
            generated a Compiled Work directly from the Work.

If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without restriction, modify the Work, thus
            creating a Derived Work. You may also distribute the Derived Work without restriction, including Compiled
            Works generated from the Derived Work. Derived Works distributed in this manner by the Current Maintainer
            are considered to be updated versions of the Work.

If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify your copy of the Work, thus creating
            a Derived Work based on the Work, and compile this Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work based on the
            Derived Work.

If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may distribute a Derived Work provided the
            following conditions are met for every component of the Work unless that component clearly states in the
            copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition. Only the Current Maintainer is allowed to add such
            statements of exemption to a component of the Work.
                If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement for a component of the Work
                    when that component is used with the Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work
                    identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that Base Interpreter, the replacement
                    component of this Derived Work clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version of
                    this component to the user when used interactively with that Base Interpreter.Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices detailing the nature of the
                    changes to that component, or a prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part of
                    the Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log of the changes.No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons, including (but not limited to) the
                    authors of the original version of the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to)
                    the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the Derived Work unless those persons have
                    stated explicitly that they do provide such support for the Derived Work.You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:
                        A complete, unmodified copy of the Work; if your distribution of a modified component
                            is made by offering access to copy the modified component from a designated place, then
                            offering equivalent access to copy the Work from the same or some similar place meets this
                            condition, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the Work along with the
                            modified component;Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete, unmodified copy of the Work.

If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement for a component of the Work
                    when that component is used with the Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work
                    identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that Base Interpreter, the replacement
                    component of this Derived Work clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version of
                    this component to the user when used interactively with that Base Interpreter.

Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices detailing the nature of the
                    changes to that component, or a prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part of
                    the Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log of the changes.

No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons, including (but not limited to) the
                    authors of the original version of the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to)
                    the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the Derived Work unless those persons have
                    stated explicitly that they do provide such support for the Derived Work.

You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:
                        A complete, unmodified copy of the Work; if your distribution of a modified component
                            is made by offering access to copy the modified component from a designated place, then
                            offering equivalent access to copy the Work from the same or some similar place meets this
                            condition, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the Work along with the
                            modified component;Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete, unmodified copy of the Work.

A complete, unmodified copy of the Work; if your distribution of a modified component
                            is made by offering access to copy the modified component from a designated place, then
                            offering equivalent access to copy the Work from the same or some similar place meets this
                            condition, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the Work along with the
                            modified component;

Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete, unmodified copy of the Work.

If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may distribute a Compiled Work generated from a
            Derived Work, as long as the Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the Compiled Work, and as
            long as the conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with regard to the Derived Work.

The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to, the modification, by any
            method, of any component so that it becomes identical to an updated version of that component of the Work
            as it is distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above.

Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative format, where the Work or that Derived
            Work (in whole or in part) is then produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax or
            nullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of applying that process.

A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license provided that license itself honors
                    the conditions listed in Clause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have to honor
                    the rest of the conditions in this license.If a Derived Work is distributed under a different license, that Derived Work must provide
                    sufficient documentation as part of itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor
                    the restrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work.

A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license provided that license itself honors
                    the conditions listed in Clause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have to honor
                    the rest of the conditions in this license.

If a Derived Work is distributed under a different license, that Derived Work must provide
                    sufficient documentation as part of itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor
                    the restrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work.

This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to the Work, nor does this license
            place any restrictions on aggregating such works with the Work by any means.

Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent complete compliance by all parties
            with all applicable laws.

## NO WARRANTY

There is no warranty for the Work. Except when otherwise stated in writing, the Copyright Holder provides
        the Work `as is', without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the
        implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality
        and performance of the Work is with you. Should the Work prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary
        servicing, repair, or correction.

In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or any
        author named in the components of the Work, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify the Work as
        permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential
        damages arising out of any use of the Work or out of inability to use the Work (including, but not limited to,
        loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure of the
        Work to operate with any other programs), even if the Copyright Holder or said author or said other party has
        been advised of the possibility of such damages.

## MAINTENANCE OF THE WORK

The Work has the status `author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder explicitly and prominently states near
        the primary copyright notice in the Work that the Work can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder or simply
        that it is `author-maintained'.

The Work has the status `maintained' if there is a Current Maintainer who has indicated in the Work that
        they are willing to receive error reports for the Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail address). It
        is not required for the Current Maintainer to acknowledge or act upon these error reports.

The Work changes from status `maintained' to `unmaintained' if there is no Current Maintainer, or the person
        stated to be Current Maintainer of the work cannot be reached through the indicated means of communication for
        a period of six months, and there are no other significant signs of active maintenance.

You can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with any existing Current Maintainer to take
        over this role.

If the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer of the Work through the following
        steps:

Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and the Copyright Holder, if the two differ)
            through the means of an Internet or similar search.

If this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work is still maintained.
                If it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer to update their communication data
                    within one month.If the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active maintenance is taken by the Current
                    Maintainer, then announce within the pertinent community your intention to take over maintenance.
                    (If the Work is a LaTeX work, this could be done, for example, by posting to comp.text.tex.)

If it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer to update their communication data
                    within one month.

If the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active maintenance is taken by the Current
                    Maintainer, then announce within the pertinent community your intention to take over maintenance.
                    (If the Work is a LaTeX work, this could be done, for example, by posting to comp.text.tex.)

If the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass maintenance of the Work to you, then
                    this takes effect immediately upon announcement.If the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright Holder agrees that maintenance of
                    the Work be passed to you, then this takes effect immediately upon announcement.

If the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass maintenance of the Work to you, then
                    this takes effect immediately upon announcement.

If the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright Holder agrees that maintenance of
                    the Work be passed to you, then this takes effect immediately upon announcement.

If you make an `intention announcement' as described in 2b. above and after three months your intention
            is challenged neither by the Current Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other people, then you
            may arrange for the Work to be changed so as to name you as the (new) Current Maintainer.

If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes reachable once more within three months of a
            change completed under the terms of 3b) or 4), then that Current Maintainer must become or remain the
            Current Maintainer upon request provided they then update their communication data within one month.

A change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact that the Work is distributed under
        the LPPL license.

If you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should immediately provide, within the Work, a
        prominent and unambiguous statement of your status as Current Maintainer. You should also announce your new
        status to the same pertinent community as in 2b) above.

## WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE

This section contains important instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering
        distributing their works under this license. These authors are addressed as `you' in this section.

### Choosing This License or Another License

If for any part of your work you want or need to use *distribution* conditions that differ significantly
        from those in this license, then do not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead, distribute
        your work under a different license. You may use the text of this license as a model for your own license, but
        your license should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that your work is distributed under
        the LPPL.

The document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains the motivation behind the conditions of
        this license. It explains, for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public License (GPL) was
        considered inappropriate. Even if your work is unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex' may still
        be relevant, and authors intending to distribute their works under any license are encouraged to read it.

### A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution

It is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own personal use, without also meeting the
        above conditions for distributing the modified component. While you might intend that such modifications will
        never be distributed, often this will happen by accident — you may forget that you have modified that
        component; or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified version that you are thus
        distributing it and violating the conditions of this license in ways that could have legal implications and,
        worse, cause problems for the community. It is therefore usually in your best interest to keep your copy of the
        Work identical with the public one. Many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work without
        altering any of its licensed components.

### How to Use This License

To use this license, place in each of the components of your work both an explicit copyright notice
        including your name and the year the work was authored and/or last substantially modified. Include also a
        statement that the distribution and/or modification of that component is constrained by the conditions in this
        license.

Here is an example of such a notice and statement:

Given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in this license document would apply, with
        the `Work' referring to the three files `pig.dtx', `pig.ins', and `pig.sty' (the last being generated from
        `pig.dtx' using `pig.ins'), the `Base Interpreter' referring to any `LaTeX-Format', and both `Copyright Holder'
        and `Current Maintainer' referring to the person `M. Y. Name'.

If you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your Work, change `maintained' above into
        `author-maintained'. However, we recommend that you use `maintained', as the Maintenance section was added in
        order to ensure that your Work remains useful to the community even when you can no longer maintain and support
        it yourself.

### Derived Works That Are Not Replacements

Several clauses of the LPPL specify means to provide reliability and stability for the user community. They
        therefore concern themselves with the case that a Derived Work is intended to be used as a (compatible or
        incompatible) replacement of the original Work. If this is not the case (e.g., if a few lines of code are
        reused for a completely different task), then clauses 6b and 6d shall not apply.

### Important Recommendations

The LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the files of the Work. It is therefore
        important that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the Work. This could, for
        example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of the Work near the copyright notice of each file or
        by using a line such as:

in that place. In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine
        what is considered by you to comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be entitled to make
        reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise the Work.

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR
    "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
    AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS
    LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
    CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

        form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from
        the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the
        purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or
        phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be
        considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.

"Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and
        anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works
        listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute
        intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more
        other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are
        assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation
        (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.

"Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed at
        https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by Creative Commons as being essentially
        equivalent to this License, including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains terms that have the
        same purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the
        relicensing of adaptations of works made available under that license under this License or a Creative Commons
        jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as this License.

        including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be
        the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a
        lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a
        choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a
        cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work
        of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are
        assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map,
        plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a
        performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any
    uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with
    the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants
    You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
    exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as
        incorporated in the Collections;

to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any
        medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the
        original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to
        Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";

to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,

to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and
    limited by the following restrictions:

You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a
        copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute
        or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License
        or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
        the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
        to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You
        Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work
        that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
        under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this
        does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If
        You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
        Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from
        any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section
        4(c), as requested.

You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a
        later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons
        jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this
        License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the
        Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you
        license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable
        License"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I)
        You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You
        Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the
        terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights
        granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices
        that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as
        included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the
        Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability
        of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
        the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this
        does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the
        Applicable License.

If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a
        request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,
        reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
        applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties
        (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's
        copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the
        title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
        specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
        information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit
        identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author,"
        or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be
        implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a
        minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection
        appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other
        contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the
        purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may
        not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original
        Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the
        separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law,
        if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
        Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work
        which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
        jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the
        right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
        action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as
        appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
        reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
        otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO
    REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
    WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE
    ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
    SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
    LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
    SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the
        terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this
        License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
        compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this
        License.

Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the
        applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
        under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
        election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be,
        granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless
        terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient
        a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
        the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the
        validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
        parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
        provision valid and enforceable.

No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver
        or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here.
        There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here.
        Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This
        License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the
        terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September
        28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
        Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject
        matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according
        to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national
        law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not
        granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is
        not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights
        holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other
        rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only,
        are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for
        use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright
        and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and
        conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary
        before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly
        mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under
        an exception or limitation to copyright. More
            considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
        licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and
        conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable
        exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only
        permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the
        licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other
        rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or
        described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where
        reasonable. More
            considerations for the public.

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions

        extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in
        consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in

            Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a

            related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui

            Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and
            Similar Rights.

Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of
            proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO
            Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.

Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and
            conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your
            use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public
            License.

Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that
            requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance,
            distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public
            including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time
            individually chosen by them.

Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from
            Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
            databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the
            world.

You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this
            Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the
                Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or
                warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other.

                purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of
                errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full
                or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.

To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory
                (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental,
                consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this

            liability.
