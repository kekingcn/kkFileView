### Pictures for some samples
#### 1. Text Preview  
It supports preview of all types of text documents. Because there are too many types of text documents, it is impossible to enumerate them. The default open types are as follows:  txt,html,htm,asp,jsp,xml,json,properties,md,gitignore,log,java,py,c,cpp,sql,sh,bat,m,bas,prg,cmd  
The text preview effect is as follows

#### 3. Word document preview
Doc and docx document previews are supported. There are two modes of word previews: one is that each page of word is converted to picture previews, the other is that the whole word document is converted to PDF, and then previews PDF. The applicable scenarios of the two modes are as follows  
* Picture preview modes: the word file is large, and the whole PDF loaded in the foreground is too slow  
* Pdf Preview modes: intranet access, loading PDF fast  
The preview effect of picture preview mode is as follows

mp3,wav,mp4,flv  
The video preview effect is as follows  
![media1](https://kkview.cn/img/preview/preview-video.png)  
The audio preview effect is as follows

Considering space issues, the pictures of other types of documents will not be shown here.You can deploy it by yourself if you are interested in our project.There is a way to deploy it as below.

### Quick Start
> Technology stack
- Spring boot： [spring boot Development Reference Guide](http://www.kailing.pub/PdfReader/web/viewer.html?file=springboot)
- Freemarker
- Redisson 
- Jodconverter
> Dependencies
- Redis(Optional, Unnecessary by default)
- OpenOffice or LibreOffice(Integrated on Windows, will be installed automatically on Linux, need to be manually installed on Mac OS)

1. First step：`git pull https://github.com/kekingcn/file-online-preview.git`

2. Third step：Run the main method of FilePreviewApplication.java.After starting,visit `http://localhost:8012/`.
