      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

LEGAL ISSUES
============

In plain English:

1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,
   please let us know!)
2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.
3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a
   program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
   you've used the IJG code.

In legalese:

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.
All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
software".

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
assumed by the product vendor.


ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
the foregoing paragraphs do.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot
legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,
support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
code.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
GIF decoders.

We are required to state that
    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
    CompuServe Incorporated."

          trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce,
          modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original
          Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or
          as part of a Larger Work; and

          Original Code (or portions thereof).

          (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are
          effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes
          Original Code under the terms of this License.

          (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
          granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2)
          separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused
          by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the

          and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

          (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or

          and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions
          of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have
          made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that
          Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of

          Version (or portions of such combination).

          (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are
          effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of
          the Covered Code.

          (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is

          infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
          that Contributor.

3. Distribution Obligations.

     3.1. Application of License.
     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
     distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
     version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
     an additional document offering the additional rights described in
     Section 3.5.

     3.2. Availability of Source Code.
     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

     3.3. Description of Modifications.
     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
     the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
          (a) Third Party Claims.
          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
          intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
          distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

          (b) Contributor APIs.
          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
          also include this information in the LEGAL file.

               (c)    Representations.
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
          this License.

     3.5. Required Notices.
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
     terms You offer.

     3.7. Larger Works.
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
     understand it.

5. Application of this License.

     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

     6.1. New Versions.
     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
     will be given a distinguishing version number.

     6.2. Effect of New Versions.
     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
     Covered Code created under this License.

     6.3. Derivative Works.
     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
     the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
     "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
     this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
     shall survive.

     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
     You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:

     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
     the 60 day notice period specified above.

     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
     Participant.

     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
     license.

     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
     prior to termination shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

     The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
     software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
     rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
     With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
     States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
     Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
     License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

     Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
     "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
     Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
     by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

     Public License Version 1.1.

     Additional Terms applicable to the Netscape Public License.
          I. Effect.
          These additional terms described in this Netscape Public
          License -- Amendments shall apply to the Mozilla Communicator
          client code and to all Covered Code under this License.

          II. "Netscape's Branded Code" means Covered Code that Netscape
          distributes and/or permits others to distribute under one or more
          trademark(s) which are controlled by Netscape but which are not

          III. Netscape and logo.
          This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks
          "Netscape", the "Netscape N and horizon" logo or the "Netscape
          lighthouse" logo, "Netcenter", "Gecko", "Java" or "JavaScript",
          "Smart Browsing" even if such marks are included in the Original
          Code or Modifications.

          IV. Inability to Comply Due to Contractual Obligation.
          Prior to licensing the Original Code under this License, Netscape
          has licensed third party code for use in Netscape's Branded Code.
          To the extent that Netscape is limited contractually from making
          such third party code available under this License, Netscape may
          choose to reintegrate such code into Covered Code without being
          required to distribute such code in Source Code form, even if
          such code would otherwise be considered "Modifications" under
          this License.

          V. Use of Modifications and Covered Code by Initial Developer.
               V.1. In General.
               The obligations of Section 3 apply to Netscape, except to
               the extent specified in this Amendment, Section V.2 and V.3.

               V.2. Other Products.
               Netscape may include Covered Code in products other than the
               Netscape's Branded Code which are released by Netscape
               during the two (2) years following the release date of the
               Original Code, without such additional products becoming
               subject to the terms of this License, and may license such
               additional products on different terms from those contained
               in this License.

               V.3. Alternative Licensing.
               Netscape may license the Source Code of Netscape's Branded
               Code, including Modifications incorporated therein, without
               such Netscape Branded Code becoming subject to the terms of
               this License, and may license such Netscape Branded Code on
               different terms from those contained in this License.

          VI. Litigation.
          Notwithstanding the limitations of Section 11 above, the
          provisions regarding litigation in Section 11(a), (b) and (c) of
          the License shall apply to all disputes relating to this License.

         creation of Modifications.

    1.2. ``Contributor Version'' means the combination of the Original Code, prior
         Modifications used by a Contributor, and the Modifications made by that
         particular Contributor.

    1.3. ``Covered Code'' means the Original Code or Modifications or the 
         combination of the Original Code and Modifications, in each case including
         portions thereof.

    1.4. ``Electronic Distribution Mechanism'' means a mechanism generally accepted
         in the software development community for the electronic transfer of data.

    1.5. ``Executable'' means Covered Code in any form other than Source Code.

    1.6. ``Initial Developer'' means the individual or entity identified as the
         Initial Developer in the Source Code notice required by Exhibit A.

    1.7. ``Larger Work'' means a work which combines Covered Code or portions thereof
         with code not governed by the terms of this License.

    1.8. ``License'' means this document.

    1.9. ``Modifications'' means any addition to or deletion from the substance or
         structure of either the Original Code or any previous Modifications. When
         Covered Code is released as a series of files, a Modification is:

        A. Any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file containing Original
           Code or previous Modifications.

        B. Any new file that contains any part of the Original Code or previous Modifications. 

    1.10. ``Original Code'' means Source Code of computer software code which is
          described in the Source Code notice required by Exhibit A as Original Code,
          and which, at the time of its release under this License is not already Covered
          Code governed by this License.

    1.11. ``Source Code'' means the preferred form of the Covered Code for making 
          modifications to it, including all modules it contains, plus any associated
          interface definition files, scripts used to control compilation and
          installation of an Executable, or a list of source code differential
          comparisons against either the Original Code or another well known,
          available Covered Code of the Contributor's choice. The Source Code can
          be in a compressed or archival form, provided the appropriate decompression
          or de-archiving software is widely available for no charge.

    1.12. ``You'' means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under,
          and complying with all of the terms of, this License or a future version
          of this License issued under Section 6.1. For legal entities, ``You''
          includes any entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under common
          control with You. For purposes of this definition, ``control'' means
          (a) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management
          of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of
          fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares or beneficial
          ownership of such entity. 

2. Source Code License.

    2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.
    The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
    license, subject to third party intellectual property claims:

        (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute
            the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications,
            or as part of a Larger Work; and

        (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Initial Developer,
            to make, have made, use and sell (``Utilize'') the Original Code
            (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent
            is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Original Code
            (or portions thereof) and not to any greater extent that may be necessary
            to Utilize further Modifications or combinations. 

    2.2. Contributor Grant.
    Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
    license, subject to third party intellectual property claims:

        (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute
            the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof)
            either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered
            Code or as part of a Larger Work; and

        (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor,
            to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), but solely
            to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable
            You to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), and
            not to any greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize further
            Modifications or combinations. 

3. Distribution Obligations.

    3.1. Application of License.
    The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed
    by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2.
    The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the
    terms of this License or a future version of this License released under
    Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy
    of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms
    on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version
    of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
    an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

    3.2. Availability of Source Code.
    Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made
    available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on
    the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic
    Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version
    available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
    must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
    initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent
    version of that particular Modification has been made available to such
    recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
    remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained
    by a third party.

    3.3. Description of Modifications.
    You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file
    documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of
    any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is
    derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial
    Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source
    Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation
    in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

    3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

        (a) Third Party Claims.
        If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right
        in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License),
        you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled
        ``LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim in
        sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you
        obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as
        described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in
        all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps
        (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably
        calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new
        knowledge has been obtained.

        (b) Contributor APIs.
        If Your Modification is an application programming interface and You
        own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that
        API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file. 

    3.5. Required Notices.
    You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code,
    and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe
    recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more
    Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described
    in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
    Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location
    (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for
    such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,
    support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
    Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
    behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
    clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
    offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
    and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
    such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms
    You offer.

    3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
    You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements
    of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include
    a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available
    under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You
    have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously
    included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
    collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered
    Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license
    of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided
    that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license
    for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
    rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License.
    If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must
    make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are
    offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
    hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for
    any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
    result of any such terms You offer.

    3.7. Larger Works.
    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not
    governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a
    single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this
    License are fulfilled for the Covered Code. 

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
    with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation
    then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent
    possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such
    description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and
    must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
    extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently
    detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 

5. Application of this License.

    This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the
    notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code. 

6. Versions of the License.

    6.1. New Versions.
    Netscape Communications Corporation (``Netscape'') may publish revised and/or
    new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a
    distinguishing version number.

    6.2. Effect of New Versions.
    Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License,
    You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also
    choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the
    License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to
    modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

    6.3. Derivative Works.
    If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do
    in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this
    License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Mozilla'',
    ``MOZILLAPL'', ``MOZPL'', ``Netscape'', ``NPL'' or any confusingly similar
    phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear
    that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla
    Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
    Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A
    shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.) 

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

    COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ``AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT 
    WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
    WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
    PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE
    DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR)
    ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
    OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED
    CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 

8. TERMINATION.

    This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
    if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within
    30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered
    Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this
    License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond
    the termination of this License shall survive. 

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
    NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER
    CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF
    SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
    INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
    LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE
    OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN
    IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR
    PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE
    LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
    OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND
    LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

    The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as that term is defined in
    48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer software''
    and ``commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used
    in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and
    48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government
    End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein. 

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
    hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable,
    such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make
    it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions
    (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
    its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least
    one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business
    in, the United States of America: (a) unless otherwise agreed in writing,
    all disputes relating to this License (excepting any dispute relating to
    intellectual property rights) shall be subject to final and binding arbitration,
    with the losing party paying all costs of arbitration; (b) any arbitration
    relating to this Agreement shall be held in Santa Clara County, California,
    under the auspices of JAMS/EndDispute; and (c) any litigation relating to
    this Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts
    of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara
    County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
    without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses.
    The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
    Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that
    the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
    apply to this License. 

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

    Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section
    3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out
    of Your utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of
    copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received from
    utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to work with
    affected parties to distribute responsibility on an equitable basis.

ii) additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
derivative works, in source code and object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed
Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.
This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to
its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual
property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
before distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright
rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in
this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and
non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and
fitness for a particular purpose;

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
damages, such as lost profits;

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by
that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor,
and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a
medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to
control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in
any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of
program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to
a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient
under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In
addition, If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under
Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve
as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the
Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement
is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its
Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections
2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the
intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether
expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in
any resulting litigation.

	Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.

3. Distribution Obligations. 

3.1. Application of License.

	The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are 
	governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation 
	Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be 
	distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version 
	of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a 
	copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You 
	distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code 
	version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this 
	License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include 
	an additional document offering the additional rights described in 
	Section 3.5. 

3.2. Availability of Source Code.

	Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be 
	made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License 
	either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted 
	Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an 
	Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic 
	Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) 
	months after the date it initially became available, or at least six 
	(6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification 
	has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for 
	ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the 
	Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. 

3.3. Description of Modifications.

	You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a 
	file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and 
	the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that 
	the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original 
	Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the 
	Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an 
	Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the 
	origin or ownership of the Covered Code. 

3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.

	(a) Third Party Claims.

	If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's 
	intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights 
	granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor 
	must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled 
	"LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim in 
	sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If 
	Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made 
	available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly 
	modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available 
	thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate 
	mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who 
	received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained. 

	(b) Contributor APIs.

	If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming 
	interface ("API") and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses 
	which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must 
	also include this information in the LEGAL file. 

	(c) Representations.

	Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 
	3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications 
	are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has 
	sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

3.5. Required Notices.

	You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source 
	Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source 
	Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a 
	location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely 
	to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s) 
	You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in 
	Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation 
	for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership 
	rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to 
	charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability 
	obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You 
	may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial 
	Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than 
	any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is 
	offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial 
	Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the 
	Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, 
	support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. 

3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.

	You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the 
	requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, 
	and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of 
	the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, 
	including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the 
	obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included 
	in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or 
	collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the 
	Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered 
	Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may 
	contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in 
	compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the 
	Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's 
	rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this 
	License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different 
	license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ 
	from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial 
	Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the 
	Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by 
	the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such 
	terms You offer. 

3.7. Larger Works.

	You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code 
	not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger 
	Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the 
	requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. 

	If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this 
	License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to 
	statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with 
	the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) 
	describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description 
	must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must 
	be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the 
	extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be 
	sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to 
	understand it.

5. Application of this License. 

	This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has 
	attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License. 

6.1. New Versions.

	Sun Microsystems, Inc. ("Sun") may publish revised and/or new versions 
	of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a 
	distinguishing version number. 

6.2. Effect of New Versions.

	Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the 
	License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that 
	version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms 
	of any subsequent version of the License published by Sun. No one 
	other than Sun has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered 
	Code created under this License. 

6.3. Derivative Works.

	If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may 
	only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code 
	governed by this License), You must: (a) rename Your license so that 
	the phrases "Sun," "Sun Public License," or "SPL" or any confusingly 
	similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your 
	license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear 
	that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the 
	Sun Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, 
	Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A 
	shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this 
	License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. 

	COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS'' BASIS, 
	WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, 
	WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF 
	DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. 
	THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE 
	IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, 
	YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE 
	COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER 
	OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF 
	ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION. 

	8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate 
	automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure 
	such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All 
	sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall 
	survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their 
	nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License 
	shall survive. 

	8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement 
	claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer 
	or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom 
	You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that: 

	(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly 
	infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such 
	Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License 
	shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, 
	unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)  
	agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable 
	royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such 
	Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to 
	the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days 
	of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not 
	mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim 
	is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under 
	Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of 
	the 60 day notice period specified above. 

	(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's 
	Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then 
	any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) 
	and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, 
	sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that 
	Participant. 

	8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant 
	alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or 
	indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as 
	by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent 
	infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses 
	granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken 
	into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or 
	license. 

	8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,  all 
	end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) 
	which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder 
	prior to termination shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. 

	UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT 
	(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL 
	DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, 
	OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR 
	ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY 
	CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, 
	WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER 
	COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN 
	INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF 
	LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY 
	RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW 
	PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE 
	EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO 
	THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. 

	The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 
	C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" 
	and "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are 
	used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 
	12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all 
	U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights 
	set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS. 

	This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject 
	matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be 
	unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent 
	necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by 
	California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if 
	any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. 
	With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, 
	or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United 
	States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be 
	subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern 
	District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, 
	California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including 
	without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and 
	expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on 
	Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. 
	Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract 
	shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this 
	License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. 

	As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is 
	responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, 
	out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to 
	work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such 
	responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or 
	shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE. 

	Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as 
	?Multiple-Licensed?. ?Multiple-Licensed? means that the Initial 
	Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under 
	Your choice of the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the 
	Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

Exhibit A -Sun Public License Notice.
